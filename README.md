## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've always been interested in data, especially how it answers questions or allows you to better understand the answer. Questions are something that I find extremely important because for as long as I remember I have been always thinking about what is the right answer or the truth. I would say that utilizing data in a more empirical sense and then taking those insights to allow for better answers or decision making is something I find extremely enjoyable.
